==== Hardware PWM Code Optimisation

*About Hardware PWM Code Optimisation*

The Hardware PWM module support is implemented by Great Cow BASIC to up to four channels.

For compatibility all channels are supported.

To mimise the code, use the following to disable support for a specific Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP) module.

----

		#define USE_HPWMCCP1 FALSE
		#define USE_HPWMCCP2 FALSE
		#define USE_HPWMCCP3 FALSE
		#define USE_HPWMCCP4 FALSE

----


To further mimise the code, use the following to disable support for a specific PWM channels.  Only PWM channels 6 and 7 are supported.

----

		#define USE_HPWM6 FALSE
		#define USE_HPWM7 FALSE

----

To further mimise the code, use the following to disable support for a specific timers.

----

		#define USE_HPWM_TIMER2 TRUE
		#define USE_HPWM_TIMER4 TRUE
		#define USE_HPWM_TIMER6 TRUE

----



*Example*

This will save 335 bytes of program memory by removing support for CCP1, CCP2 and CCP4.
