== Using Great Cow BASIC

Need to compile a program with Great Cow BASIC, but don't know where to begin? Try these instructions:

. First, download and install Great Cow BASIC. It's best if you let everything install to its default directory (folder).
. Open up the folder that contains Great Cow BASIC. This is generally `C:\GCB@SYN`.
. Open the folder that contains the program you want to compile. Make sure that you open it in a new window.
. Drag the icon of the file you want to compile onto `gcbasic.exe`. The compiler will open, compile the file, and then close again.
. A file called `compiled.hex` will have been created. Download this to your microcontroller^(1)^, and you're set to go!

[small]#^(1)^ You need a suitable programmer to do this, and instructions should be
included with the programmer on how to download to the microcontroller.#
