|*Switch*
|*Description*
|*Default*

|`/O:__filename__`
|Sets the name of the assembly file generated to `_filename_`.
|Same name as the input file, but with a `.asm` extension.

|`/A:assembler`
|Batch file used to call assembler^(1)^. If `/A:GCASM` is given, Great Cow BASIC will use its internal assembler.
|The program will not be assembled

|`/P:programmer`
|Batch file used to call programmer^(1)^. This parameter is ignored if the program is not assembled.
|The program will not be downloaded.

|`/K:{C\|A}`
|Keep original code in assembly output. `/K:C` will save comments, `/K:A` will preserve all input code.
|No original code left in output.

|`/V`
|Verbose mode - compiler gives more detailed information about its activities.
|-

|`/L`
|Show license and exit.
|-

|`/NP`
|Do not pause on errors. Use with IDEs.
|Pause when an error occurs, and wait for the user to press a key.

|`/WX`
|Force compiler to ensure all include files are valid.
|

|`/version`
|Shown build date and version of the compiler.
|

|`/S`
|Load the settings from a specified file, rather than use the defaults.
|


|`filename`
|The file to compile.

[small]#^(1)^ For the `/A:` and `/P:` switches, there are special options available. If
`%FILENAME%` is present, it will be replaced by the name of the `.asm` file.
`%FN_NOEXT%` will be replaced by the name of the `.asm` file but without an
extension, and `%CHIPMODEL%` will be replaced with the name of the chip.
The name of the chip will be the same as that on the chip data file.#

A batch to to load the `ASM` from Great Cow BASIC into `MPASM`. I think that your
`m.bat` should be like this:
----
@ECHO OFF
echo C:\progra~1\microc~1\mpasms~1\MPASMWIN /c- /o- /q+ /l- /x- /w1 %code%.asm
C:\progra~1\microc~1\mpasms~1\MPASMWIN /c- /o- /q+ /l- /x- /w1 %code%.asm
