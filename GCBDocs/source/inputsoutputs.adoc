=== Inputs/Outputs

*About Inputs and Outputs*

Most general purpose pins on a microcontroller can function in one of
two modes: input mode, or output mode.

When acting as an input, the pin will be placed in high impedance state.
The microcontroller will then sense the pin, and the program can read
the state of the pin and make decisions based on it.

When in output mode, the microcontroller will connect the pin to either
Vcc (the positive supply), or Vss (ground, or the negative supply). The
program can then set the state of the pin.

Great Cow BASIC will attempt to determine the direction of each pin, and set it
appropriately. However, if the pin is read from and written to, then
then pin must be configured to input / output mode by the program, using
the appropriate <<_dir,Dir>> commands.
