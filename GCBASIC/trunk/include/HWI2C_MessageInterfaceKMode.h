'''An I2C Message Handler for GCGB and GCB.
'''------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' Description: this ISR library provides an ISR to implement
''' a stateful i2c hardware slave.
''' This is a GCB implementation of Microchip Application Note AN734.
'''
''' This library provides an message interface to i2c hardware slave.
''' It relies on the GCB implementation of Microchip Application Note AN734.
'''
''' The user needs to supply a procedure to process the received message.
''' Basically, this i2c slave waits for a full message to arrive. Then it calls
'''
''' the user procedure to process the message and (optional) prepare a response.
'''
''' Subsequently, this lib will pass the response data over to the master, if
''' it wants to have them.
'''
''' Callbacks:
''' - HI2C_Process_In_Message( HI2CIndex as byte )
'''      called when i2c amaster starts a talk.  HI2CIndex is the length of the incoming packet
'''
''' - HI2C_Process_Outgoing_Message
'''      called when i2c amaster needs to a talk.
'''      HI2CBUFFER should be populated with the data to be sent.
'''
'''   All other methods are Callbacks from the ISR routine.
'''
'''   Sebastien Lelong and Joep Suijs are credited with JAL implementation.
