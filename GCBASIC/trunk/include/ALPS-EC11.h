'
' encoder routines for ALPS mechanical rotary encoder
' EC11B/ EC11E/ EC11G/ EC11J with push-Button
' all these have two different stable detents: A and B are High or Low
' followig graph will show:
'
'   --:,   :,---:,    H
' A   :|   :|   :|
'     :'---:'   :'--- L
'     :    :    :
'   ,-:--, :  ,-:--,  H
' B | :  | :  | :  |
'   ' :  '-:--' :  '- L
'     :    :    :
'     det1 det2 det1
'
' Because of two possible different states at any detent,
' you have to separate the detent positions from transient,
' in order to become 1 count between 2 detents.
' First transient (i.e. A from H to L) is counted,
' second (i.e. B from L to H) is not regarded. To get the direction
' of turning makes XOR between old and new position of A and B.
'
' You have to define the encoder-bits to ports

'Variables exposed by include file are:
'Alps_ESB_Bit is a bit that is exposed to detect state of button. Detects event has occurred
'Alps_EncoderEvent is a bit that is exposed to detect state of button. Detects event has occurred
'Alps_CurrentPosition is a public Integer value that is the current rotational value
'Alps_Directn is a public bit that is the current direction of the encoder

' Before entering the main program, the starting state
' of the encoder bits (a detent position) is stored
' to the variables new and old, bit 6 and 7.
