'    Release notes
'    Supports a single DS18B20 only.
'    Device serial port/pin needs to be defined in main program
     ' Port/pin settings, an example is shown below:
     ' #define DQ PortA.0
'    These routines use the 12 bit sensor functionality.
'    These routines will NOT work with DS18S20. This a 9 bit sensor and these routines will not work.

'     11/2013 updated to support with the 12 bit DS18b20 with temperature range from negative to positive as per device datasheet
      ' Uses Subroutine "ReadDigitalTemp" instead of function as it's complicated with decimal places
      ' modified to read negative number using XOR to convert 2's complement to signed integer
      ' Reads two bytes into 16 bit signed integer variable.
      ' A string varible "lookup table" stores the decimal digits.
      ' Timings lengthened slightly to handle long wires. Tested reliably with 3 meter cable.
      ' Oscilloscope shows 0 -> 5V (10% -90%) rise time of 14 uS with 3 Meter cable length
      ' Logic high stable time is 14uS to 28uS after pulse start

       'To read a value, call the ReadDigitalTemp subroutine.
         'DSint holds the decimal temperature
         'DSdec string holds the decimal places

'     8/2014  updated to return integer and raw data values. Improved documentation
'     updated to support GCGB
      ' New Functions "Readtemp" and "Readtemp12"

      ' Readtemp
        ' Reads temperature from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and store in
        ' the output variable.  The conversion takes up to 750ms.  Readtemp carries out a full 12 bit
        ' conversion and then rounds the result to the nearest full degree Celsius (byte
        ' value). For the full 12 bit value use the readtemp12 command.

        ' The temperature is read back in whole degree steps, and the sensor operates from
        ' -55 to + 125 degrees Celsius. Note that bit 7 is 0 for positive temperature values
        ' and 1 for negative values (ie negative values will appear as 128 + numeric value).
        ' Note the readtemp command does not work with the older DS1820 or DS18S20
        ' as they have a different internal resolution. This command is not designed to be
        ' used with parasitically powered DS18B20 sensors, the 5V pin of the sensor must
        ' always be connected.

      ' Readtemp12
        ' Reads 12 bit temperature data from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and
        ' store in variable. The conversion takes up to 750ms. Both readtemp and
        ' readtemp12 take the same time to convert.
        ' This command is for advanced users only. For standard ‘whole degree’ data use the readtemp command.
        ' The temperature is read back as the raw 12 bit data into a word variable (0.0625
        ' degree resolution). The user must interpret the data through mathematical
        ' manipulation. See the DS18B20 datasheet for more information on the 12 bit
