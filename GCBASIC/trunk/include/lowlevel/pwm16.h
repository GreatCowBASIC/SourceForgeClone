' 28/08/17   Initial version
' 09/09/17   Error in claculation of log2 fixed.
'            Potential overflow error fixed in calculation on HPWM16_PRPS_Req
'            Supports PWMChannels 1-12, with #ifdefs to allow code to be disabled
'            Prescalar is no longer calculated, but can be user specified for sub 1 kHz PWM
' 24/09/17   PWMxPHH set to zero (undefined at power on, messes up DC calculation)
'            PWMxxLDCON.LDA changed to PWMxxLD
'            Tweak to Log2 function to save some program memory
'            All variable names prefixed with HPWM16_ (except those reused from PWM functions)
' 02/10/17   Added HPWM16On and HPWM16Off commands for fixed frequency/duty PWM
' 05/11/17   Revised to handle fixed mode operations, changed constants to map to PWM.h
'            revised script hanlder, new init and code validation
' 11/11/17   Fixed problem with calculation of duty cycle
' 26/01/19   Overflow/calculation errors fixed when working out duty cycle registers
' 14/02/21   Added CHIPPWM16TYPE validation
' 15/20/21   Removed PWM16 script warning
