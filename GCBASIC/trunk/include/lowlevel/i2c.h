'     0.82 - Improved ACKPOLL handling
'     0.83 - Improved ACKPOLL handling - added I2CReturnState to return error condition
'     0.83 - Added default sub values
'     0.84 - Added Optional I2CGETACK As byte = TRUE to maintain SLAVE compatibility
'     0.85 - Improved stability and corrections
'     0.86 - Delete v2 subs
'     0.87 - Added new sub I2CSlaveDeviceReceive to handle slave correctly.  I2CSlaveDeviceReceive thisI2CSlavedevice, readDeviceAddress, TRU
'     0.88 - Revised timings and ensured the DATA line goes low at end of process.
'     0.89 - Revised I2CAckPollState = I2CSendState

'     0.94 - Revised to Move variable defintion to prevent variable defintion when not required
'    - Eliminated parameter on I2CSend as this was causing backward compatibility issues
'    - This is a megerd version of the alternate version of the software I2C routines by
'          - Thomas Henry, July 17, 2014.
'          - ACK/NAK logic for Slave multibyte reception
'          - therefore multiple Slaves are permitted on the bus
'    - eliminated need for a separate addressed slave read command,
'    - reduced the command set to make I2C more understandable
'    - made the basic commands more intuitive for beginners
'    - eliminated redundant code while speeding up the loops
'    - a single error flag (I2CAck or I2CSendState) checks many error conditions
'    - more extensive documentation
'    - eliminated redundancies and unneeded global variables
'    - accounted for parameter corruption throughout
'     0.95 revised to restore I2C_Dev_OK
'     0.96 revised to support I2C_USE_TIMEOUT for I2C Master
'     To enable failsafe in I2C Master mode, user must add #define I2C_USE_TIMEOUT to source code
'    Updated Oct 2016  - for Option Explicit



'    - With the default constants, communication can be as high as 75 kHz.

'    - Command Set (parameters I2CAck and I2C_Dev_OK are optional):

'    -   I2CStart() and I2CStop() are the usual commands used to start
'    -   and stop I2C communications. I2CAckPoll() is used to sense
'    -   whether the Slave device is alive and ready to respond. It
'    -   is also useful for waiting until an Eeprom has completed its
'    -   write cycle. The optional parameter I2C_Dev_OK reports whether
'    -   the device responded or timed out.

'    -   The two high-level commands are I2CReceive() and I2CSend().
'    -   Either of these may be used in either Master or Slave mode.
'    -   For emphasis, this means that the following combinations
'    -   are valid:

'    -   Master receives from the Slave
'    -   Slave receives from the Master
'    -   Master sends to the Slave
'    -   Slave sends to the Master

'    -   Additionally, a fair amount of error detection is worked in
'    -   which can detect certain problems, typically with the SCL
'    -   (clock) line. By using the error flag (a parameter called
'    -   I2CAck) it is possible to have the Master or Slave retry the
'    -   communication in case of errors. The parameter I2CAck is
'    -   optional, and may be ignored in many situations. Note, too,
'    -   that clock stretching is implemented which gives the Slave
'    -   a chance to get caught up when needed. This is invisible to
'    -   the programmer/user.

'    -   Interrupts are always disabled during I2C communication.
'    -   since it makes no sense to permit interruptions in a
'    -   synchronous environment.

'    -   The purpose of the parameter I2CByte in these two commands is
'    -   obvious--it is the byte which is received or transmitted.
'    -   On the other hand, the second parameter, I2CAck, can be used
'    -   in a couple different ways to monitor for error conditions,
'    -   among other things. Here are the details for the two commands.

'    -   *** I2CReceive(out I2CByte, in/out I2CAck)

'    -   MASTER FROM SLAVE:
'    -   In Master mode, if your program sets I2CAck to TRUE before
'    -   calling I2CReceive(), then the Master will send an ACK to
'    -   the Slave after receiving its byte. If FALSE then the Master
'    -   will send a NAK to the slave after receiving its byte
'    -   ACK and NAK are aliases for TRUE and FALSE, respectively.

'    -   SLAVE FROM MASTER:
'    -   In Slave mode, upon exit from I2CReceive(), the Slave will
'    -   set I2CAck to TRUE if things went well, or FALSE if a timeout
'    -   occurred (supposing you had requested timeouts be used).

'    -   *** I2CSend(in I2CByte )

'    -   MASTER TO SLAVE:
'    -   In Master mode, I2CAck is returned to indicate whether an
'    -   ACK or a NAK was received from the Slave after transmission.
'    -   ACK means all is okay, while NAK means something went wrong.

'    -   SLAVE TO MASTER:
'    -   In slave mode, I2CAck is returned to indicate whether an ACK
'    -   or a NAK was received from the Master after transmission.
'    -   ACK means all is okay, while NAK means something went wrong.

'    -   Please note: for many programs, you simply won't need the
'    -   error detection and can ignore the value of the I2CAck parameter.
