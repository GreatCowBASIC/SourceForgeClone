'Notes:
' Supports KS0108 controller only.

'Changes
' 14/4/2014: Fixed KS0108 GLCDCLS CS1/CS2 line set correctly.
' 05/5/2014: Revised Line, and added Circle and FilledCircle
' 05/5/2014: Revised KS0108 read sub... timing was incorrect
' 05/5/2014: Revised GLCD to ensure the screen is cleared properly
' 08/5/2014: Revised to comply with documentation requirements
' 09/5/2014: Fixed circle and line to ensure cross device compatibility
' 11/5/2014: Revided to expose old line drawing routines
' 17/6/2014: Revised to correct error in KS0108 PSET routine.
' 28/6/2014: Revised GLCDDrawString.  Xpos was always 1 extra pixel to right.
' 14/8/2014: Removed GLCDTimeDelay to improve timing and a tidy up.
' 1/11/2014: Revised to support single controller.
'
' 9/11/14 New revised version.  Requires GLCD.H.  Do not call directly.  Always load via GLCD.H
' 31/7/15 Added GLCDDirection test to invert display
' 17/10/15 Corrected KS0108ClockDelay was KS0108_Clock_Delay and the other waits were not implemented - most odd. Erv
' 11/02/19  Removed GLCDDirection constant from script as this was impacted KS0108 library
