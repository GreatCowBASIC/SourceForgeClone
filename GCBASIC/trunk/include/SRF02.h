' LIBRARY FOR SRF02 ULTRASONIC SENSOR MODULE IN I2C MODE
' V0.2 Peter Everett 30/11/2014

' The SRF02 is a small ultrasonic transeiver with built in calibration and measurement processing
' It can be accessed using I2C or SPI (This library is for the I2C mode)
' The module has a typical range from 16 cm to 6 m
' Information on the module can be found here http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/srf02tech.htm

' Revision history
' 0.1 07/11/2014  Initial version
' 0.2 30/11/2014  Change address function fixed and tested including error handling

' FUNCTION LIST AND STATUS

' SRF_Measure       Tested in cm and inches Oct 2014.  uS gives a result so assumed correct.
' SRF_FakeMeasure   Tested Nov 2014.  2 sensors on same I2C bus but seems to detect ping and measure correctly
' SRF_Ping          Tested Nov 2014.  2 sensors on same I2C bus but ping seems to be detected by other sensor
' SRF_GetResult     Tested Oct 2014
' SRF_GetCalib      Tested Nov 2014
' SRF_SWVer         Tested Nov 2014
' SRF_ChangeAddr    Tested Nov 2014
