''' Usage:
'
' Dim User_ID as Word
' User_ID = GetUserID( Index )
'
' Reads the memory location 0x8000 + Index and returns it as a Word value.
;
' where Index = 0x0 to 0xB as follows:
;
;    Address      Function            Read  Write
;    8000h-8003h  User IDs              Yes   Yes
;    8006h/8005h  Device ID/Revision ID         Yes   No
;    8007h-800Bh  Configuration Words 1 through 5   Yes   No
;
; Refer to your particular Device Datasheet to confirm the address table
