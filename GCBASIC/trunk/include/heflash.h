'''GCB Library for reading/writing to High Endurance Flash Memory
'''-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''The high endurance flash memory (HEFM) is a block of 128 locations found
'''at the top of the Flash program memory. Each location can only be used to
'''hold a byte variable (whereas the standard Flash memory for a mid-range
'''PIC MCU will typically hold 14 bits of information).
'''
'''The main difference between EEPROM and HEFM is that the former does allow
'''byte-by-byte erase whereas the latter does not. With HEFM data must be
'''erased before a write and this can only be performed in blocks
'''(referred as rows) of a fixed size associated with the chip design.
'''
'''The heflash.h library provide the following variables for the current
'''list of chips supporting this design :
'''  HEFLASH_ROWSIZE : size of a HEFM row. 16 or 32 words (byte variable)
'''  HEFLASH_START   : starting address of HEFM (word variable)
'''  HEFLASH_END     : ending address of HEFM (word variable)
'''
'''These are the user's oriented functions/subroutines:
'''  HEFreadBlock  : sub to read a HEFM row into a n bytes buffer array
'''  HEFreadByte   : byte function to read a HEFM row at a given offset
'''  HEFRead       : sub equivalent to EPRead sub for EEPROM
'''  HEFwriteBlock : sub to write a buffer array of n bytes in a HEFM row
'''  HEFWrite      : sub equivalent to EPWrite sub for EEPROM
'''
'''WORD OF CAUTION:
'''Whenever you update the hex file of your PIC with your programmer you
'''will erase the data that are stored in HEFM.  If you want to avoid that
'''you will have to flash your PIC with a software that allow memory exclusion
'''when flashing. This is the case of Microchip MPLAB IPE :
'''(Go In Advanced Mode/Enter password/Select Memory/Tick Preserve Flash
'''on Program/Enter Start and End address of your HEFM).
'''
'''This program has been adaptated from the Microchip Application note
