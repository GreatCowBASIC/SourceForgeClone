'    Release notes
'    03/02/2018     Updated to improve error handling and to work on the 18f
'    04/02/2018     Added DS18B20DeviceReadRetry to improve retry handling

'    Supports a multiport DS18B20 reads.

'    These routines use the 12 bit sensor functionality.
'    These routines will NOT work with DS18S20. This a 9 bit sensor and these routines will not work.

'    To read a value, call the readtempfromPort(port) method.
'     Returns readtemp12 and readtemp

    ' Readtemp
    ' Reads temperature from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and store in
    ' the output variable.  The conversion takes up to 750ms.  Readtemp carries out a full 12 bit
    ' conversion and then rounds the result to the nearest full degree Celsius (byte
    ' value). For the full 12 bit value use the readtemp12 command.

    ' The temperature is read back in whole degree steps, and the sensor operates from
    ' -55 to + 125 degrees Celsius. Note that bit 7 is 0 for positive temperature values
    ' and 1 for negative values (ie negative values will appear as 128 + numeric value).
    ' Note the readtemp command does not work with the older DS1820 or DS18S20
    ' as they have a different internal resolution. This command is not designed to be
    ' used with parasitically powered DS18B20 sensors, the 5V pin of the sensor must
    ' always be connected.

    ' Readtemp12
    ' Reads 12 bit temperature data from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and
    ' store in variable. The conversion takes up to 750ms. Both readtemp and
    ' readtemp12 take the same time to convert.
    ' This command is for advanced users only. For standard whole degree data use the readtemp command.
    ' The temperature is read back as the raw 12 bit data into a word variable (0.0625
    ' degree resolution). The user must interpret the data through mathematical
    ' manipulation. See the DS18B20 datasheet for more information on the 12 bit
    ' Note the readtemp12 command does not work with the older DS1820 or DS18S20 as they have a different internal resolution.
    ' This command is not designed to be used with parasitically powered DS18B20 sensors, the 5V pin of the sensor must be connected.
