;Square root function for Great Cow Basic.

;Logarithmic Functions for Great Cow Basic
;Thomas Henry --- 5/1/2014
;Evan R. Venn ---- 27/9/2014

;These functions compute base 2, base e and base 10 logarithms
;accurate to 2 decimal places, +/- 0.01. The values returned are
;fixed-point numbers, with two decimal places assumed on the right.
;Or if you prefer, think of the values as being scaled up by 100.

;The input arguments are word-sized integers, 1 to 65535.
;Remember, logarithms are not defined for non-positive numbers.
;It is the calling program's responsibility to avoid these.
;Output values are also word-sized.

;Local variables consume 9 bytes, while the function parameters
;consume another 4 bytes, for a grand total of 13 bytes of RAM
;used. The lookup table takes 35 words of program memory.
