Attached an update to the DarwinBuild/build.sh shell script (in 
sync with Great-Cow-BASIC-Help/source/macosoverview.adoc 
file).

Shell script pkg2dmg.sh which is the build script to take the Packages 
(http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html) generated .pkg 
file installation for macOS and create the compressed disk image (.dmg) 
file.
