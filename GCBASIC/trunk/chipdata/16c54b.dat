';Microcontroller specific configuration. Constants used within specific libraries, the compiler or user programs. All sourced from chip data database.
';This section of constants is specific to a microcontroller.  Therefore, the constants may not be present for a specific microcontroller.

'ChipStacks can be used within  user programs.  This constant provides information with respect to the stack depth available 
Stacks=8
