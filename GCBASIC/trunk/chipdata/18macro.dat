';Microcontroller specific configuration. Constants used within specific libraries, the compiler or user programs. All sourced from chip data database.
';This section of constants is specific to a microcontroller.  Therefore, the constants may not be present for a specific microcontroller.

[Interrupts]
'For specific details of the interrupts see the microcontrollers datasheet.
'The first parameter is the Great Cow BASIC identifier used within user code to expose the specific interrupt.

[Registers]
'For specific details of the registers see the microcontrollers datasheet.
'The first parameter is the Great Cow BASIC register name that can be used within user code to expose the specific register.

[Bits]
'For specific details of the bits (all bits are relative to a register in terms of register.bits) see the microcontrollers datasheet.
'The first parameter is the Great Cow BASIC bit name that can be used within user code to expose the specific register.bit.

[FreeRAM]

[NoBankRAM]

[ASMConfig]
'The Great Cow BASIC compiler default configuration for a specific microcontroller

[ConfigMask]

[ConfigOps]
'For specific details of the config options see the microcontrollers datasheet.
'The first parameter is the configuration field that can be used to expose the specific configuration bits.
'The others parameter are the options the configuration field that can be set.

[Config]
