I can't get the script (LCDCURSOR_2WIRE_TEST (with atmega8)) running
 with the original code in 2 wire mode.
 The only way to get it running is the use of the existing LCDCMD command,
 simply by using LCDCMD 8 to 15.
 The result is the same effect with much lesser code.

In this manner a considerable part of the extra code in the LCD.h may disappear.
 Also the subs LCDDisplayOff and LCDDisplayOn may disappear.
