''' Lesson 8 - "PWM"
'''
''' Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is a scheme that provides power to a load by switching
''' quickly between fully on and fully off states. The PWM signal resembles a square wave
''' where the high portion of the signal is considered the on state and the low portion of
''' the signal is considered the off state. The high portion, also known as the pulse width,
''' can vary in time and is defined in steps. A longer, high on time will illuminate the LED
''' brighter. The frequency or period of the PWM does not change. A larger number of
''' steps applied, which lengthens the pulse width, also supplies more power to the load.
''' Lowering the number of steps applied, which shortens the pulse width, supplies less
''' power. The PWM period is defined as the duration of one complete cycle or the total
''' amount of on and off time combined.

''' Demo1.  Rotating the POT will adjust the brightness of a single LED, DS4
''' Demo2.  Shows a how the changing PWM values across the LEDs
