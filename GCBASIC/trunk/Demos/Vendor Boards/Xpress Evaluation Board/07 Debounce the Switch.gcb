'''
''' This demonstration uses a simple software delay routine to avoid the initial noise on the switch
''' pin. The code will delay for only 5 ms, but should overcome most of the noise. The
''' required delay amount differs with the switch being used. Some switches are worse
''' than others.
'''
''' When the switch is held down, D1 will be lit. When the switch is not held down, all
''' LEDs are OFF.
