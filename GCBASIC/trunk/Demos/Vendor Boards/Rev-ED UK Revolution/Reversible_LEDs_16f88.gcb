'''  "Reversible"
'''
'''  This demonstration combines using the button to reverse the
'''  direction of rotation of the LEDs when the button is pressed. The speed of rotation is controlled
'''  using the potentiometers.
'''
'''  The program needs to keep track of rotation direction and new code needs to be added
'''  to rotate in the other direction. This rotates right and checks for a '1' in the carry
'''  bit to determine when to restart the sequence. The program needs to rotate
'''  both ways and check for a '1' in bit 7 of the display when rotating to the left. When the
'''  '1' shows up in Carry bit 4, it will be re-inserted into bit 7.
'''
'''
'''  LEDs will rotate at a speed that is proportional to the ADC value. The switch will toggle
'''  the direction of the LEDs
