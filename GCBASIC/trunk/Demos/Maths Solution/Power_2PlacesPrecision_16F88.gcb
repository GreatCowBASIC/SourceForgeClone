'''A program  for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program shows a function to raise a base to a power.
'''Remember, powers can easily become huge, so it is up to the
'''calling program to make certain your numbers remain within
'''range. The base and exponent are Byte sized numbers in any
'''event. The returned result is a Long. Non-negative numbers are
'''assumed throughout.

'''Keep in mind that 0 raised to 0 is meaningless and should be
'''avoided. But any other non-zero base raised to 0 is handled.
