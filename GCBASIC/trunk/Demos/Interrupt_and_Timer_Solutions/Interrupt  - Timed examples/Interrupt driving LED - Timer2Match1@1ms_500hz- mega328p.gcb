'''A program  for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''    Description. Interrupt driving LED using Timer2 match.
'''    This calls the Timer2Match1 every 1ms.
'''     You can use the #define SimulatePWM to either control an LED with PWM or Toggle the LED
'''    The SimulatePWM adjusts the power to the LED over 2.5 seconds, then to zero power again over 2.5 seconds with a hold of 1 second between each ramp up/down.
'''    The LED is connected to port via appropiate resistors.
