'''A program  for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''    Description. Interrupt driving LED using Timer1Overflow match.
'''    This calls the Timer1Overflow every 10ms.
'''     You can use the #define SimulatePWM to either control an LED with PWM or Toggle the LED
'''    The SimulatePWM adjusts the power to the LED over 2.5 seconds, then to zero power again over 2.5 seconds with a hold of 1 second between each ramp up/down.
'''    The LED is connected to port via appropiate resistors.
''':
'''    The important thing to note. You MUST reset the timer in the InterruptHandler routine to keep the timer set correctly.
'''
'''
'''   Use the Timer Calc' application that is part of Mister E PIC Mutl-calc tookset to calculate the value.
'''   Ensure you set the Prescaler in the InitTimer1 and the Interrupt handling routine - you need to this for Overflow timers.
