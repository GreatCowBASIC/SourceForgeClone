1.	Handling of LONGs in the context of IF/ENDIF.
          See https://sourceforge.net/p/gcbasic/discussion/596084/thread/b6a97f96/#d632 and the emails from Anobium.

2.	Handling of STR and HEX is incorrect when spaces exists in command line.
          No forum record.  Processing is incorrect when leaving a space between command the the left brace. STR ( is bad news...

3.	Timer.h does not support tmr 6
          By way of an example the current timer.h files does not support 16F1936 set of timers.

4.	Replacement I2C code with the newer routines (Oct 2013 code.
          We could replace... how much additional testing is required?
          See https://sourceforge.net/p/gcbasic/discussion/629990/thread/1a3accc6/#b94b

5.	Add two functions to String.h ASC and CHR
          These are two simple functions we could add.  New users may not be able to figure out the relationship between arrays and strings in GCB.  These may make things simpler.

6.	Error REPEAT when handling WORD variables
          See https://sourceforge.net/p/gcbasic/discussion/596084/thread/9655ed39/#979c

10.       Enhancement Request.  OPTION EXPLICIT... essentially means that all variables MUST be defined.
