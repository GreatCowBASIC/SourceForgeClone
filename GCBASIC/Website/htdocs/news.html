            </span>A German translation of Great Cow BASIC is now available, thanks to&nbsp;Peter Rabiger. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gcbasic/gcbasic-de.zip?use_mirror=">here</a>, and installed by extracting it to the GCBASIC install directory.<br>

            <br>

Some false virus detections have occured with GCBIDE. These are due to
a virus being written in the same language as GCBIDE (RapidQ Basic),
and several antivirus&nbsp;developers using a harmless part of the
virus executable to create the virus signature.<br>

            <br>

While GCBIDE is clean it is no longer hosted on this site. All programs
hosted by SourceForge.net must be open source and the developer of
GCBIDE has decided against releasing the source code for version
2.0.&nbsp;GCBIDE is still available from <a href="http://gcbide.googlepages.com/">http://gcbide.googlepages.com</a>.<br>

            </span><span style="text-decoration: underline line-through;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline line-through;"></span>Version 2.0 of GCBIDE by Emile Tredoux is available. It can be downloaded from the GCBASIC site here, or from Emile's page <a href="http://gcbide.googlepages.com/">here</a>.<br>

            <br>




Sanyaade has created a version of the SciTE editor with support for
GCBASIC syntax highlighting. This is old news now, but if you're not
one of the many people who have downloaded it already it's worth a
look. Please see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=169286&amp;package_id=272643&amp;release_id=593412">this page</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">17/4/2008<br>





            </span>Added some guidelines on how to post to the forum. If people can try to follow them it
will make answering forum posts a lot easier for us!<br>




            <br>




The link to these is on the left, right above the link to the forums.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

7/11/2007<br>





            </span>Still no fix for the issue with the Download page,
but those who have trouble downloading GCBASIC can use the standard
SourceForge.net download page at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=169286">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=169286</a>. IE 6 is not to blame as I earlier suspected, users of several other browsers have also had trouble.<br>





            <br>





Emile Tredoux has created a site for GCBIDE, located at <a href="http://gcbide.googlepages.com/">http://gcbide.googlepages.com/</a>.<br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>


23/10/2007<br>





            </span>A new version of GCBIDE, 1.3,&nbsp; is available
from the download page. GCBIDE now includes a feature which displays
the chip pinout, assigns a name (such as Pin3) to every I/O pin, and
allows the initial direction of the pins to be set. For this to work, a
new version of the chip data files must be installed.<br>





            <br>





Those who have downloaded update.zip after October 7 will already have
the needed files. Anyone else who wishes to use the tool will need to
download the new chip data files from here, and install them by
extracting the archive to C:\Program Files\GCBASIC.<br>





            <br>





The&nbsp;Getting Started page has been updated to cover the
installation of GCBIDE, BasicIDE and the WinPic programming software.<br>





            <br>





Also, some users have reported difficulty with the download links. I've
found that for some reason IE 6 often doesn't work properly when the
download links are clicked. This problem may also affect other versions
of IE, but I haven't tried them. All I can recommend is that anyone who
has trouble keeps trying, or uses another browser. I normally use
Firefox and haven't had any difficulties with the download links. If
anyone can shed some light on what is causing this trouble, please
email me (Hugh) using the email address at the bottom of this page.<br>

Two IDEs
for GCBASIC&nbsp;are now available!<br>











      <br>











Emile Tredoux has developed a simple IDE (GCBIDE) for his own use,
and kindly offered to make it available. The latest binary is&nbsp;<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gcbasic/GCBIDE_v1.2.zip?use_mirror=osdn">here</a>. The contents of the zip folder need to be extracted so
that the .exe is in the same directory as GCBASIC.<br>











      <br>











      <big><font><font color="#000000" size="2"><big>Papadopol Lucian is
currently developing an IDE for GCBASIC, BasicIDE, using VB. More
information is available <a href="http://www.swli9528ps.altervista.org/serv01.htm">here</a>, and the
program and source code are available at his <a href="http://www.swli9528ps.altervista.org/news.htm">download page</a>.
BasicIDE is available in both English and Italian. While still
heavily under development, this program is quite usable.<br>

changes made to update.zip.<br>






      <br>






Also, I have finally added the <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gcbasic/gcbasic_es.zip?modtime=1177264011&amp;big_mirror=0">
Spanish translation</a>. Presently this is available as a seperate
download, but will be added to the installer for the next version
of GCBASIC. Thanks to Pablo Curvelo for the translation, and
apologies for taking so long to upload the files.<br>

Great Cow BASIC 0.9.3.0 has been released. The most major new
features are support for 18C/18F chips (bringing to total number of
supported chips to over 300) and a new system for storing chip data
which removes the need for the #mem directive, and allows full use
of the available RAM. Some other new features are:<br>






      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>






        <li>SELECT CASE control structure</li>






        <li>Keypad support</li>






        <li>Partial bit variables</li>






        <li>Most error messages include the file and line on which the
error occurred</li>






      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>






An automated test program has been used to check for any MPASM
errors produced by a sample of 186 known good GCBASIC programs. All
of those errors found have been fixed, along with most of the bugs
mentioned on the forums.<br>






      <br>






Several pages on this site have also been updated.<br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






17/12/2006<br>





      </span> A severe bug has been found in the 4 and 8
bit LCD routines in GCBASIC, which prevents any of them from
working correctly. A fixed lcd.h file is available here - please
locate the existing lcd.h file (usually in C:\Program
Files\GCBASIC\include\lowlevel), and replace it with the new
file.<br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






4/11/2006<br>





      </span> A new version of Great Cow BASIC, 0.9.2.9, has
been released. This version contains some minor bugfixes, in
addition to Italian and Turkish translations.<br>






      <br>






A significant change in this version is that it is compiled with
FreeBASIC, not QBASIC as previous versions have been. This has
resulted in several changes - see the changelog for more
details.<br>






      <br>






Some new features were promised for the next version of GCBASIC in
the forums. These have not yet been implemented due to time
constraints - they will be in version 0.9.3.0 which will be
released within a few weeks.<br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






12/10/2006</span><br>






Version 0.9.2.0 released. Included in this new release are many new
features and bugfixes, such as new PWM routines, additional LCD
support, and many 16-bit variable bugfixes.<br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






27/9/2006</span><br>






Version 0.9.1.1 released. This is a bugfix release - it improves
support for 10/12 series chips, and chips without interrupts. The
help section on compiler directives has also been expanded, and is
near completion.<br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






17/9/2006<br>





      </span> Version 0.9.1.0 released. This includes
some&nbsp;new features such as data tables and SPI. It also has
fixes for several bugs associated with A/D conversion, RS232, and
newer PIC chips.<br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






8/9/2006<br>





      </span> Version 0.9.0.4 released. This includes support
for MPASM in addition to gputils, additional assistance for new
users (two more demos and several new help articles), and a fix for
a bug which caused errors when compiling for chips without a
low-voltage programming option.<br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






5/9/2006<br>





      </span> Removed a bug in the installer which prevented
GCBASIC from installing to directories with long names (other than
C:\Program Files). This is a minor update, and there is no need to
obtain itIt includes several bugfixes, if you already have GCBASIC installed successfully.<br>






      <br>






The latest installer now includes both the Inno Setup script used
to create the installer, and the mkcompil.bas file,&nbsp;which is
used to create the compile script.<br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;">30/8/2006</span><br>






Great Cow BASIC 0.9.0.2 released. A bug involving chips with less
than 256 bytes of RAM has been resolved.<br>






      <br>






The compiler has been changed from alpha to beta status, as it is
now feature complete. Once documentation and error checking have
been improved, it will be released as version 1.0. Please do not
hesitate to report any bugs that you find!<br>
