Thank you for installing Great Cow BASIC!

To compile a file, drag and drop it onto compile.bat. If compilation is successful, a .asm and .hex file will be produced. Download the .hex to your PIC, and you're set to go!

If you don't have an application to download the file, then we suggest you try the excellent IC-Prog program (http://www.ic-prog.com) and JDM programmer (http://www.jdm.homepage.dk/newpics.htm). More information on using Great Cow BASIC and these utilities is available at http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/starting.html.

Users of Windows 95/98/Me will need to restart to ensure that gputils is installed correctly.
